If any of the *.glsl files are modified, corresponding SPIR-V files must be updated.
Please run compile.bat/compile.sh to generate SPIRV for the GLSL shaders used in memory decompression and update the copyright information.

Note: Must have glslangValidator (found in Vulkan SDK) added to the system path.
